# quickhull-raphael

## Project Proposal

### Authors

- Gregory Haynes
- Eric O'Connell

### Topic

Quickhull algorithm

### Implementation Language

JavaScript, with RaphaelJS shiny frontend.

### Report Outline

- Algorithm Explanation
	- pseudocode
- time complexity / experimental results
	- theory
		- talk about algorithm, why n log(n)
	- experimental
		- into on implementation
		- quickhull v. bruteforce
			- random data
			- circle
			- line (horiz/vert)
- pivot selection
- comparison w/ other algorithms
- citations

### Implementation Features

- generate random 2d point map
- set region size & point count
- perform quickhull & show solution visually
- animate quickhull stepwise (w/ controls)

### Project Schedule

- Week 8:
	- Create website skeleton.
	- Random point generation.
	- Quickhull without animation.
- Week 9:
	- Start report.
	- Testing
	- Animate Quickhull.
- Week 10: 
	- Report
	- Buffer time
